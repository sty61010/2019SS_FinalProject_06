## Story of the Game
A was began between 2 leaders began. Each player attempts to take control of their opponent's base, identified with a flag. Both leaders are wealthy enough to carry unlimited bombs to use to navigate through the field and threaten their opponents. 

The rest of the world tries to intervene, and builds a great wall between the 2 leaders. However, this great wall isn't so great. Most of the walls are pooly built and easily destroyed with a bomb. Uh-oh!

Make sure to not let these leaders not that there are hidden power ups under the walls. Match these with their unlimited bombs and 5-round wins, they can rule the world.
